                    <p>Hi, I'm a freelance game dev from Kentucky! I like making things that make other people happy. I started a new company, Work-Pending Games, for this very reason. We're working on our first title, and I am filled to the brim with hype. I've worked as a professional software engineer for almost three years, and I also teach kids how to code at <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc U</a>. By day, I'm a full-stack web developer for Holley Performance Products. By night, I work as the lead designer and lead programmer for Work-Pending Games.</p>

                    <p>I'm always looking for cool projects, so don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested! I frequently participate in <a href="http://trainjam.com/" target="_blank">Train Jam</a> and <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/" target="_blank">GDC</a>, and try to make it to gaming conferences nearby. If you happen to find yourself in Lexington, KY, be sure to check out <a href="http://runjumpdev.org/" target="_blank">RunJumpDev</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to growing and cultivating the local game development community in Kentucky. I regularly collab with members of RunJumpDev on fun projects, like <a href="http://runjumpdev.org/hurdle-complete-mortimers-mansion/" target="_blank">Mortimerâ€™s Mansion</a>.</p>
