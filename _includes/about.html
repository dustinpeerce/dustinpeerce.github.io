                    <p>I like making things that make other people happy. I started my company, Work-Pending Games, for this very reason. We're working on some cool projects, and I am filled to the brim with hype. I've worked as a programming coach and mentored at <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc U</a>. By day, I'm a full-stack web developer for Holley Performance Products. By night, I work as the designer and programmer for Work-Pending Games.</p>
