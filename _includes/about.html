                    <p>Hi, I'm a freelance game developer! I currently work as a full-stack web developer for <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc</a> and <a href="http://apaxsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Apax Software</a>, where I work directly with clients in need of high-quality websites. I also teach kids how to code at <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc U</a>. I've worked as a lead instructor of game design where I've used Unity3d to teach object-oriented programming.</p>

                    <p>I received a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Eastern Kentucky University in the Fall of 2016. My concentration was Interactive Multimedia, which placed a heavy focus on game development. I've been educated and trained for every stage of the development process, including planning/prototyping, pitching, design, programming, testing, presenting, and marketing.</p>
