description: Similar to an Endless Runner, the player in Chow Down is moving infinitely through a series of obstacles. The player tilts their mobile device to move the character from side to side. Every obstacle has a door that allows passage, but the doors can only be opened with specific touch-input. Once a door has been opened, you can collect points that appear in the doorway.
inspiration: Chow Down will be free to play, and offers a very challenging experience.
