description: A Journey to You is a mirror platformer where you try to reunite two long-lost lovers. The arrow keys will move both characters at the same time, and the spacebar will make both of them jump. The challenge is to find the correct sequence of movements that gets both characters to the doors at the same time. There's no transition set up for the last level, so nothing happens when you beat the game.
inspiration: This was my submission for Global Game Jam 2015. The theme was "What do we do now?" I worked with one other person, who was responsible for art assets, prefab creation, and animation. I handled programming, level design, UI design, and sound design. The inspiration was that the two characters could only end up together if their lives followed a very specific sequence of events. The player must maintain that sequence, so the characters can be in the right place at the right time.
