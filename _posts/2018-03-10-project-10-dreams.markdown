description: A VR gallery of experiences based on the theme&#58; Dreams. Each experience was created by members of HVRE as part of a community project. Members were given the opportunity to create experiences as an individual within a larger community of developers and artists ready to help. Members were asked to brainstorm, establish a design document, manage the project scope, set goals, as well as publicly present project progress.
inspiration: I worked on Toy Room, one of the many experiences, by myself. Dreams was part of <a href="http://rulesandplay.org/" target="_blank">Rules and Play</a> in 2017, an exhibition of interactive installation art, running at the Living Arts and Science Center in Lexington, KY.
