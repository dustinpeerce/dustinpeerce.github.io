description: A crabby construction game on the beach. Build a home to match the blueprint from sand! Use WASD or arrows to move, space to create or destroy blocks. May induce rage, annoyance, or a sad reminder of the difficulty of acquiring a home in real life.
inspiration: The theme for Global Game Jam 2017 was "Waves." My team decided to use waves as a threat, which led us to ocean waves. The thought of waves crashing into sand blocks sparked an interest in voxels, and this interest quickly turned into a construction game. We didn't have time for playtesting, and our first full playthrough was when we presented the game to the jam site. Be warned, it's almost impossible to win.
