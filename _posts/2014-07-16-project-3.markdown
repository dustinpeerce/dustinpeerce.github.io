description: Spirit Fire was originally my solo submission for Global Game Jam 2016. You control a ball of spirit fire that is constantly moving towards the mouse, and you have to guide the fire to the end of each level without touching anything. I am now working on a team of four students to expand the game for our Capstone course at Eastern Kentucky University. The focus of the game has shifted to puzzles, and I am leading the design as the Creative Director and Level Designer.
inspiration: The theme for Global Game Jam 2016 was "Ritual." The idea was that you were being summoned by a powerful pyromancer, and you had to travel through time and space to complete a ritual. The story has shifted slightly to involve other wizards who want to use the Spirit Fire.
