description: This game was made for a FIO task at Awesome Inc. FIO stands for "Figure it Out," and the task determines if applicants can join the team. The requirements were simple&#58; make a game that introduces the player to the Awesome Inc Core Values.
inspiration: I thought the best way to teach the core values was to break the project into 5 areas&#58; one room for each core value, and a Hub World that connects those four rooms. Each room challenges the player with an activity that represents one of the core values. Dialog boxes are used to reinforce the player's understanding of the Awesome Inc culture.
