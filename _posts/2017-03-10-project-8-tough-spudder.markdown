description: Tough Spudder is an endless runner platformer where you choose your next level in a risk/reward fashion. If your potato is damaged, the potato skin is removed. One more hit after being skinned, and it's Game Over! You may get a new layer of skin by replaying the level that skinned you.The goal is to get the highest score!
inspiration: This was submitted for Train Jam 2017. The theme was "Unexpected Anticipation." With this theme in mind, my team brainstormed some games with unexpected events, and we decided to make a game based around the player's anticipation of the unexpected. The unexpected aspect of Tough Spudder is the mystery level that could contain anything.
