description: A table of toys is sitting in the center of a small room. Some of the toys are shaped like people and donâ€™t respond to your presence, nor do they seem to notice when you stare at them. There are motionless toys on the table as well, those that do not resemble people. It seems you have a power to bring these toys to life, and the toy people start to behave in strange ways when this happens. You get the feeling that you can activate the toys in different sequences to cause the toy people to behave in new and interesting ways.
inspiration: This was my submission for Dreams, a VR gallery of experiences based on the theme&#58; Dreams. I've decided to continue working on this game as a stand-alone experience. The goal is to build a convincing systemic environment with the toy people moving and behaving in more interesting ways, with or without player interaction.
