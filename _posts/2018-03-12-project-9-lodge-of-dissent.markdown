description: A card game of territorial acquisition. Attack enemy monsters to gain control of them, but carefully choose your attacks so your own monsters won't be left vulnerable.
inspiration: While heavily inspired by Tetra Master, Lodge of Dissent pulls from other popular card games like Hearthstone to create a unique blend. Combat is designed to be intuitive and approachable. The goal is to maintain complexity while making the game less obtuse.
