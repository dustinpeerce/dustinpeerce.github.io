description: A deck-building game of territorial acquisition. Charm enemy monsters to recruit them, and if you have more monsters than your opponent by the time the board is full, you win!
inspiration: This project has been very rewarding for me, as it is my first multiplayer game. It's also been a great way to learn more about AI, in order to build distinct computer opponents. I'm very excited to finish this game and share it with the world.
