description: In Harvest Fall, you control the character by rotating the direction of gravity. By rotating gravity, you can send the player character flying through the levels, and bounce them around to collect candy. In future levels, there would have been obstacles to avoid. I only spent about 5 hours on the game, so there's only one level to test the mechanics.
inspiration: This was my solo submission for EKU Fall Game Jam 2015. The theme for the game jam was "What goes up must come down." This made me want to make a game that plays with gravity. If I continued the project, I would remove the Halloween themed assets and make it more of a sci-fi experience. It would be more physics-based, as well. This is definitely a concept that I plan to revisit.
