description: Jet Cadets is a 2-player jetpack-fireman water-blasting game! Fill up the jug at the bottom of the screen to maximum capacity. The player who has the most liquid in the jug by the time it fills wins! A Gamepad is required. Use the left analog-stick to use your jetpack, and use the right analog-stick to use your water-blaster. I worked on programming the Input/Physics Controller.
inspiration: Jet Cadets was made for Train Jam 2016, where the theme was "Maximum Capacity." My team of five went through a lot of brainstorming before landing on this idea. The original idea had the two players connected to fire hoses, and the blast of the hoses would move the characters. We removed both of these features on the last day because it made the characters too difficult to control.
